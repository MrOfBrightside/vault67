Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Mayor - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --wisp --labels=polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\ngt nudge \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads.
